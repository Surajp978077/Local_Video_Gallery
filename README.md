# LocalVideoGallery

LocalVideoGallery is a web application that allows you to explore and play videos from your local directory right in your web browser. Easily preview, play, and manage your video collection through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

To get started with LocalVideoGallery, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/Surajp978077/Local_Video_Gallery.git
2. Move the video files into the cloned directory ./Local_Video_Gallery 
3. Run the `launch.cmd` file by double-clicking on it.
4. This will launch the LocalVideoGallery web page in your default web browser.

## Usage

1. Upon launching the LocalVideoGallery page, you will see a grid of video thumbnails.

2. Hover over a video thumbnail to preview the video.

3. Click on a video thumbnail to open the video in fullscreen mode.

4. While in fullscreen mode, you can use the playback controls to play, pause, and navigate through the video.

5. To exit fullscreen mode, click the "X" button in the top-right corner or press the "Esc" key.

6. The page supports both video files with the `.webm` and `.mp4` extensions.

7. The application also remembers your playback progress for each video, so you can resume where you left off.

## Troubleshooting

- If you're unable to launch the page using the `launch.cmd` file, ensure that your browser is up-to-date and that you have the necessary permissions to run scripts and open web pages.
